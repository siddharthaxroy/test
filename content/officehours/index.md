[The Coach Effect](https://atrpodcast.com/episodes/the-coach-effect-s1!5c657), an episode from Michael Lewis' podcast, gave me the obvious idea that anyone interested in doing science and research or going to graduate school may benefit from speaking with someone who is "on the inside." If you have questions, I want to help through a phone or Zoom call. The conversation would be private and off the record. It would last 15-20 minutes and I will try to answer as much as I can about what I know.
