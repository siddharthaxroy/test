| <img src="olivia-ackerson.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;"> | **Olivia Ackerson, Environmental Science, RA**<br>Olivia Ackerson is a junior at Rutgers University, majoring in Environmental Science with a minor in Environmental Policy, Institutions, and Behavior. She is passionate about addressing climate change, advancing environmental policy, and furthering science communication. Olivia is working as a research assistant under Dr. Roy, involved in research on policies to mitigate lead in drinking water in low- and middle-income countries. She is also assisting with research on lead in Chicago’s water supply and consumer trust/public perceptions surrounding this issue. |
| <img src="aanand-aggarwal.jfif" width="150" height="150" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;"> | **Aanand Aggarwal, Computer Science and Information Technology & Informatics, Aresty RA**<br>My name is Aanand Aggarwal and I am a senior in the SAS Honors Program. I am pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Information Technology & Informatics, and I am in my first semester of the 5-Year BA/MI Program in Data Science. A fun fact about me is that I have two rescue dogs that are siblings, and I have two birds that are also siblings. My research interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics; I'm eager to work under Dr. Roy to explore their applications within aquatic chemistry and public health.  |
| <img src="bobo-auyeung.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;"> | **Bobo Au-Yeung, Psychology and Criminal Justice, Aresty RA**<br>My name is Bobo Au-Yeung and I am a Psychology and Criminal Justice double major with a minor in Health Administration. My professional and research interests lie in mental and physical preventative health, in hopes of addressing the shortage of medical services available. I spend my free time working on 2D animation projects. My current research aims to identify and formulate an intervention process to alleviate the psychological effects of negative messaging (nocebo), particularly in children post-environmental crises. |
| <img src="ishani-bhaumik.png" width="150" height="150" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;"> | **Ishani Bhaumik, Chemistry, Aresty RA**<br>My name is Ishani Bhaumik and I am a second-year Chemistry major with interest in environmental issues pertaining to chemistry. I have previous experience writing about what possible chemical processes aid in reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This year, I am working with Dr. Roy to investigate trends of lead release from pipes into potable water in New Jersey.  |
| <img src="charlene-guo.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;"> | **Charlene Guo, Environmental Science, Aresty RA**<br>Charlene Guo is a second-year student at Rutgers University majoring in environmental science. She has been captivated by science from a young age and aspires to use it to serve and improve our society and planet. This year, she will analyze wastewater and biomonitoring data to investigate lead release into tap water, following up on the Flint Water Crisis. |
| <img src="daniella-mangibin.JPG" width="150" height="150" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;"> | **Daniella Mangibin, Computer Science, Aresty RA**<br>Hello, I am Daniella Mangibin, and I am a third-year student at Rutgers University studying Computer Science and Data Science. I am interested in applying my technical skills to make advancements and address key challenges in the life sciences, particularly in areas such as the environment and health. My Aresty project is to build a deep learning model that will recognize types of corrosion on potable water pipes and plumbing. I look forward to the project's results and impact! |
| <img src="leyla-munoz.JPG" width="150" height="150" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;"> | **Leyla Muñoz, Public Health, Aresty RA**<br>HI! My name is Leyla Munoz, and I am a Public Health major at Rutgers University. I am very interested in epidemiologic and policy-related research. For this project, I will focus on wastewater and blood lead surveillance and give an update on the Flint Water Crisis. |
