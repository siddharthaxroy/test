I graduated from Wellesley College in 2025 with a BA in Geosciences, focusing on environmental geochemistry and environmental justice. In the Roy Lab, I research urban water contamination in New Jersey, including lead in schools and contaminants in tap and flood waters following natural disasters. I am passionate about environmental justice and health equity. Throughout my PhD, I aim to build relationships between the Roy Lab and nearby environmentally at-risk communities, mentor within the lab, and contribute to making water safer for people in New Jersey and around the world. |

Her research focuses on drinking water quality, with an emphasis on corrosion, metal leaching, and safe material use in decentralized water systems such as private wells, borehole handpumps, and small community supplies. Her work aims to improve understanding of corrosion processes and inform safer material choices for drinking water systems in low- and middle-income countries. She previously earned her master’s degree in environmental engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, and a Bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Jennie’s broader research interests include water treatment, contaminant fate and transport, and sustainable approaches for ensuring safe drinking water access. Outside of research, she enjoys hiking, playing volleyball, and exploring local coffee shops. |
| {{< image src="emily-newton.jpg" width="200" height="200" style="object-fit: cover; border-radius: 50%;" >}} | **Emily Newton, Environmental Science, Masters student** <br> \| My name is Emily Newton, and I am a master's environmental science student with a bachelor's in forensic science. I am looking to work in the forensic environmental science field, including contamination and ecological crimes. Additionally, I am passionate about entomology and its relevance in these topics. My experience is in connecting entomology and molecular biology laboratory work, and investigating environmental site contamination. This year, I will focus on one contamination event to give it the attention it did not receive. |
