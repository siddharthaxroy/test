This is a personal living document, subject to frequent revision.

### Science:
- Apply the scientific method with rigor and intellectual humility[^15]
- Science is about seeking the truth[^4], not group consensus
- Science is NOT self-correcting, but SCIENTISTS can help correct science through vigorous and good-faith criticism[^22]
- Several possible answers do not mean all of them are equally likely[^9]
- “Trust” is science's main product
- The public should strive to think in scientific ways[^17] to evaluate, question and counter expert claims[^13]
- "A good scientist is someone who comes up with new ideas. A good engineer is someone who makes things work with as few new ideas as possible." - Freeman Dyson
- Guiding questions: How am I wrong?[^5] Can I be less wrong than I was yesterday?[^16][^21]

### Service and public good:
- First Canon: "To hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public"
- Reduce human suffering, advance well-being, and promote collective flourishing
- Public university obligations: Practice science as a public good
- United Nations SDG #6.1: "ensure safe drinking water for all" 
- United Nations' Resolution on the Human Right to Water
- Engineer a “healthier and more resilient world” - National Academies[^7]
- Apply tenets of “Effective Altruism”[^6] to research
- Prioritize issues in environmental justice communities[^8]

### How to think and act[^2]:
- Learn to navigate ethical dilemmas and cognitive biases
- Exercise (and urge in others) civic and moral courage
- Emphasize "truth over justice"[^1] to fight real (environmental) injustice[^27]
- Defend free speech and open inquiry
- Sign the [Pro-Truth Pledge](https://www.protruthpledge.org/), or, at the very least, do not [lie](https://ia902601.us.archive.org/34/items/pdfy-x4ByD3mMjIdTMC0H/Sam%20Harris%20Lying%20(1).pdf)
- Be charitable in interpreting others' words and actions, unless there are reasons not to
- With students and mentees, work hard to dispel ["Excellent Sheep"-level conformity](https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/we-arent-raising-adults-we-are-breeding?s=r)
- Seek out direct feedback, especially the critical variety[^18]
- Support claims with evidence[^14], not calls for blind faith
- Act with skin in the game:[^24] Are you prepared to pay a price if you are wrong? Otherwise, how can we trust your findings and recommendations?
- Bring light to a debate over heat through evidence, conversation, and seeking middle ground
- Avoid blind optimism or pessimism about social issues and bridge the Optimism Gap[^11] with facts
- Cultivate rational optimism about scientific and human progress[^19]
- Counter perverse incentives by choosing quality over quantity[^10]
- Promote the right incentives and rewards for your collaborators[^28] and advisees to act like ambitious high-agency principals and not agents[^25]
- Level up your game by learning from the peers around you doing exceptional work (and rightly getting rewarded for it), instead of burning in envy[^23]
- Do not pursue research topics you unwittingly absorbed through mimesis[^26], unless you are genuinely curious

### Statistics:
- Stats 001: Without data, you are just someone with an opinion[^20]
- Stats 001.1: Outrage, offense, and empty virtue-signals are not data points
- Stats 101: Anecdotes are not reliable[^3] 
- Stats 101.1: Large datasets are usually more reliable than anecdotes/anecdata
- Stats 201: Correlation is not causation[^12]
- Stats 201.1: Correlation can tend to causation with multiple lines of evidence and tightly controlled studies (e.g., RCTs)

#### Footnotes:

[^1]: If you care about justice, you have to find out what is true first. Read [this *Atlantic* piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/academics-truth-justice/574165/) for more. Also, from Cicero: For the discovery of truth, it is necessary to argue against all things and for all things.

[^2]: See the [HxA Way](https://heterodoxacademy.org/library/the-hxa-way/) for a guiding set of norms and values on pluralism, rigorous debate, constructive disagreement, and intellectual charity.

[^3]: Read ["Anecdotes Are Not Reliable"](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/tips-better-thinking-anecdotes-are-not-reliable) from McGill's Jonathan Jarry.

[^4]: Brandeis' Eve Marder in her [eLife article](https://elifesciences.org/articles/66850) describes the pursuit of "truth even unto its innermost parts" and the professional need for "challenging anyone who spreads falsehoods," the corollary of which is others will (and should) challenge our own claims. Separately, criticizing ideas is not the same as criticizing those advocating for them. Read Simine Vazire's Slate article ["Criticizing a Scientist’s Work Isn’t Bullying. It’s Science"](https://slate.com/technology/2017/10/criticizing-a-scientists-work-isnt-bullying.html) for an extremely well-reasoned argument. Finally, marrying the above ideals of uncovering scientific truths with a deep reflection on what it means to be [truly honest](https://psyche.co/ideas/more-than-just-truth-telling-honesty-is-a-virtue-to-cultivate) might also convince you to [sign the Pro-Truth Pledge](https://www.protruthpledge.org/) to bring more honesty in public discourse, even if it sometimes hurts your pet cause.

[^5]: From Thomas Gilovich: For desired conclusions, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe this?”, but for unpalatable conclusions, we ask, “Must I believe this?”

[^6]: As in, pursue research topics that are societally relevant, traditionally neglected or understudied, and can be addressed with technical expertise, policy/systemic changes, and/or behavioral interventions.

[^9]: Read ["The Fallacy of Gray"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dLJv2CoRCgeC2mPgj/the-fallacy-of-gray) on LessWrong for perspective on the simplistic argument that everything in science is gray. Also, from Issac Asimov: "When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."

Also, from Steven Pinker writing in *Enlightenment Now*: "To look at data showing that violence has gone down and say "Violence has gone down" is to describe a fact. To look at data showing that violence has gone down and say "Violence has gone up" is to be delusional. To ignore data on violence and say "Violence has gone up" is to be a know-nothing."

[^13]: Andrew Oxman and 24 other researchers have penned a brilliant *Nature* Comment on teaching non-scientist members of the public [key concepts for making informed choices](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02407-9).

[^14]: Read Scott Alexander's clear-eyed perspective on honestly and responsibly using the phrase "no evidence" in science communication on [*Substack*](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-phrase-no-evidence-is-a-red-flag).

[^15]: Beyond the obvious, intellectual humility can help us realize the true privilege of being a scientist, and asking and pursuing answers to big questions. Elizabeth Loftus articulates this beautifully in this [*Psychology Today*](https://staff.washington.edu/eloftus/Articles/psytoday.htm) profile.

[^16]: Karl Popper in *Knowledge without Authority*: "All 'sources' are liable to lead us into error at times. And I propose to replace, therefore, the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different question: 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?'"

[^17]: Adoption of what Julia Galef calls [the Scout Mindset](https://twitter.com/juliagalef/status/1381978961941573632) can allow you to craft more accurate maps of reality.

[^18]: In a culture of growing double-speak and toxic positivity masking true intentions, having colleagues, well-wishers or even adversaries who offer you [the gift of valuable feedback you didn’t have before](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-18-How-to-criticize-coworkers/) is a true blessing. Cultivate relationships, where tight feedback loops to collectively get to what is true, is the norm.

[^19]: One of the core theses of quantum physicist David Deutsch in *The Beginning of Infinity* is that problems are inevitable. But, unless constrained by the laws of nature, problems are also solvable. What we need and will always need essentially are new knowledge, creativity, and human ingenuity that can produce good explanations that lead to solutions. This inevitably leads to cultivation of a deep and rational optimism. Or, consider Marquis de Condorcet writing in his [*Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind*](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1181&context=ccr): "How consoling for the philosopher who laments the errors, the crimes, the injustices which still pollute the earth and of which he is often the victim, is this view of the human race, emancipated from its shackles, released from the empire of fate and from that of the enemies of its progress, advancing with a firm and sure step along the path of truth, virtue and happiness! It is the contemplation of this prospect that rewards him for all his efforts to assist the progress of reason and the defence of liberty." E. O. Wilson's *Consilience* is also a must read.

[^21]: Good to strive for a balance between [the careless "expertise creep" and the necessary "epistemic trespassing."](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-hysterical-style-in-the-american-humanities)

[^22]: Review two ongoing cases where we are attempting to correct the scientific record through post-publication expressions of concern: a) [Flint educational outcomes paper in Science Advances](https://retractionwatch.com/2024/07/15/did-flint-water-crisis-set-kids-back-in-school-paper-saying-so-is-severely-flawed-say-critics/#more-129627) and b) [Water lead filters have an astounding 50% mortality rate conference article in International Journal of Infectious Diseases](https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/19/after-we-tried-to-correct-claims-about-deadly-water-filters-in-flint-we-were-accused-of-scientific-misconduct-and-that-was-just-the-beginning/).

[^24]: Read our short paper ["Addressing the Preprint Dilemma"](https://x.com/siddharthaxroy/status/1466444187369357314) for insights on why this matters.

[^25]: Review the [principal-agent problem](https://nav.al/principal-agent).

[^28]: Be at least fair with sharing (deserved) grant money and do not go back on your promises. When an institute assured me that a major grant I helped write had been awarded, they explicitly encouraged me to hire a student to carry out key research. That "in good faith" assurance was unequivocal. Now, they have shifted course, claiming they do not need the student as much (and will barely fund them), while primarily requesting my time. Now, I am in a pickle. Check back in a year.
