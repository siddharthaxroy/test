title: "First Principles"
---

------
Science:
- Apply the scientific method with rigor and intellectual humility
- Science is about seeking the truth, not group consensus
- Several possibilities do not mean all of them are equally likely
- “Trust” is science's main product
- Guiding questions: How am I wrong? Can I be less wrong than I was yesterday?

Service and public good:
- Bring light, over heat, through evidence, conversation, and compromise
- First Canon: "To hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public"
- Reduce suffering, advance well-being, and promote collective flourishing
- Public University obligations: Science as a public good
- United Nations SDG #6.1: "ensure safe drinking water for all"
- Apply tenets of “Effective Altruism” to research

How to act[^2]:
- Learn to navigate ethical dilemmas and cognitive biases
- Exercise (and urge in others) civic and moral courage
- Emphasize "truth over justice"[^1] to fight real (environmental) injustice
- Unwaveringly defend free speech and open inquiry
- Prefer being confident over claims using evidence over blind faith
- Counter perverse incentives: quality over quantity

Statistics:
- Stats 001: Without data, you are just someone with an opinion
- Stats 001.1: Outrage, offense, and empty virtue-signals are not data points
- Stats 101: Anecdotes/Anecdata << Large datasets
- Stats 201: Correlation is not causation
- Stats 201.1: Correlation tends to causation using multiple lines of evidence and tightly controlled studies (e.g., RCTs)
